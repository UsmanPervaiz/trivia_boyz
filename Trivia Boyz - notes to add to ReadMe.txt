An app is a piece of software that can run
through a web browser or even offline on any electronic device.

Apps may or may not have a connection to the internet.
App is a modern take on the word software.

You typically only hear it in reference to a mobile app
or a small piece of software that's running on a website.

It's used to describe anything that isn't a full-fledged software program.
There are three main types of apps: desktop, mobile, and web.

Example: Google Maps APIs lets developers embed Google Maps
on webpages using a JavaScript or Flash interface.
